# Budget Buddy: Empowering Financial Futures

## Introduction

In a world where the stock market is often seen as inaccessible or intimidating, especially to younger generations, Budget Buddy emerges as a beacon of empowerment. Recognizing that a staggering 70% of young Canadians steer clear of investing in their future through the stock market, we've set out to demystify the investment landscape. Our mission is clear: to furnish users with reliable, easy-to-understand information about investment opportunities, enabling them to make informed decisions about their financial futures.

## About Budget Buddy

Budget Buddy is more than just a financial tool; it's your companion in navigating the complexities of personal finance. Designed to keep users on track with their budgets, it provides a transparent view of where money is going, encouraging smarter spending and saving habits. Through our platform, users gain access to:

- **Up-to-Date Information:** From savings accounts to investment opportunities, we provide the latest data to help you make precise financial decisions.
- **Real-Time Stock Data:** Explore a vast array of sectors within the stock market, equipped with real-time data to inform your investment choices.
- **Projection Tools:** Visualize the potential growth of your investments, empowering you to plan for a brighter financial future.

## Technologies Used

To bring Budget Buddy to life, we leveraged the power of modern web development technologies:

- **Next.js:** The second-best React.js framework, offering robust features for building interactive user interfaces.
- **TailwindCSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs without leaving your HTML.
- **TypeScript:** Enhancing our development process with strong typing to catch errors early.
- **Clerk:** For secure, seamless authentication processes.

- **Vercel:** Our choice for hosting, ensuring that Budget Buddy is accessible anywhere, anytime.

## Challenges & Triumphs

Our journey wasn't without its hurdles. From the overwhelming initial phases to technical challenges integrating features like the budget calculator, we faced each obstacle head-on. Despite these challenges, our determination never wavered. We're proud of the resilience and teamwork that brought Budget Buddy from concept to reality, providing a tool that meets and exceeds our initial vision.

## What We Learned

This project was a profound learning experience for our team. Not only did we enhance our technical skills in web development and get hands-on experience with React, JavaScript, and version control with Git, but we also deepened our understanding of teamwork and project management. These lessons will be invaluable as we continue to develop and improve Budget Buddy.

## Looking Ahead

The future of Budget Buddy is bright. We're not stopping here; we plan to:

- **Expand our budget tool:** Introducing features that allow users to compare their financial habits over time and set accountability goals.
